- 👋 Hi, I’m @FCJFB a.k.a Felix C.J. Falk , im an senior year Electronic and Automatic Engineering student 
- 👀 I’m interested in Electronic and Automatic Engineering Projects, but also love to tinker in my freetime, so I created a github to finally gather all my projects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning git,PyQt framework and SQL databases for my final university project. As soon as I somehow finish these projects ill try to do something
related to Machine Learning, or Computer Vision to future proof myself and  to expand my repository
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who wants to make something interesting where my skills could be applied. Ideally I would want to collaborate with any Elon Musk
related Company, but also, who whouldnt ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
